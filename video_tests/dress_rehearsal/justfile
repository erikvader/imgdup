# Will do exactly the same thing as the real deal, but with fewer video files.
# Expected results:
# - Nothing in the buffer folder should be a duplicate of anything.
# - The ignored frame(s) should show up in the graveyard.
# - Only one collision per frame, not two, i.e. no two mirrored frames match each other.
# - The two identical videos 'identical' shall have many collisions since its the exact same video.
# - The videos 'trailers' shall not have any collisions, the trailers at the end should be ignored.
# - The videos 'phase' shall be duplicates of each other, they are out of phase and are thus tricky.
